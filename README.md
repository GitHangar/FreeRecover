Description: FreeRecover is a free file recovery program for Windows. It allows you to search and preview deleted files on NTFS drives to find lost data. It also estimates the integrity of the deleted files, as well as retrieve their original paths. This is a mirror of the original SourceForge repository at https://sourceforge.net/projects/freerecover/, created by dcorphan.

This program runs on Windows 10, and most likely on 7/8/11 as well but I haven't tested it. It was written with Visual Basic, and consumes very little RAM (5MB on idle). This is a straightforward, efficient program that finds deleted files very fast. I have not found any information regarding building instructions, nor any licenses inside the program - assume GPLv2, which is the one mentioned in the SourceForge page, although it is nowhere to be found on the program itself. I was not able to find any profiles or information regarding the original creator dcorphan, either.

Tip: After deleting something you want to recover, don't write anything to the drive containing the data, as it might overwrite the deleted files. This also means it is highly advised not to recover deleted files to the same drive they were in before. Programs like this one work are designed with HDD's in mind, and they might not work properly with SSD's.
